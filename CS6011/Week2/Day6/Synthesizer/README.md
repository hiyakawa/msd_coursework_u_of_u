# Synthesizer

#### Muyuan (Laura) Zhang

## Overview

This is a synthesizer application powered by JavaFX.
It allows you to generate sine wave sounds with specific frequency and volume scale,
and even mix the sine waves to create terrible (but fun) noizes!

## Features

* Buttons to play C4 (Central Cee) to B4 keys

* Cables that can connect sine wave widgets to volume control widgets, 
or volume control widgets to the speaker

* Retro Win2000-style user interface ;)
