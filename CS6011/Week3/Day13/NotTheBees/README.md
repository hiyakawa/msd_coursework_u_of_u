# Not The Bees!

#### Muyuan (Laura) Zhang

## Overview

**Not the Bees!** is a meme portrayed by Nicolas Cage in *The Wicker Man*...
Sorry, wrong quote. This is a web game based on Java, JavaScript, and HTML. 
All you are going to do is to move the cursor and manipulate the honey pot to 
get rid of the bees. Have fun!

## Features

* Click and redirect to welcome/game page

* Vivid random movement of bees (which can be a little bit creepy)

* Cute as a vintage!
